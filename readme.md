# WheatStone project
This project was made in early 2020 by me and another student as a end-of-year project for our C# class. <br/>It aims to recreate the pixel and bitmap librairies of C# from scratch and implement them in multiple ways, including
 basic LSB steganography, generating qr-code, histograms or fractals, and manipulating images with filters and tools. <br/> Unfortunately it only has a console interface but it still looks nice :3 <br/> <br/> The name of the project
 was inspired from Charles Wheatstone with his invention of the stereogram, which i implemented in the form of autostereogram generation in the project.
